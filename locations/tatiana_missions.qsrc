Most of the books in this part of the library are books on magic, ranging from magic theory and philosophical works to spellbooks on geomancy and shamanism. It''s one of the biggest collections of its kind in this country, I''ve been told."'

		'"Well, not all of it. But this is where you can come to learn about magic, where you can learn what you need to know in order to be able to cast spells and all that," she explains.'
		'You take a moment to let that sink in. Only a short time ago, you had no idea magic existed, and now here you are, standing in the middle of a public library, and you realize that this knowledge was there all along, right under everybody''s noses. And what knowledge it must be... "Can I read whatever I like?"'

The heavy parchment contains diagrams, hand-drawn images and hundreds of pages worth of text, you can see them... but their meaning seems to slip away every time you think you are getting ahold of it.'

I wasn''t kidding when I said that I tried cutting corners with the reading: I <b>hate</b> reading; loathe it, really. Not the ''getting smarter'' part of it but the physical act of sitting down in dark libraries and sticking my nose into dusty scrolls and books. But," she points towards the rows upon rows of bookcases, packed with books all the way up to the ceiling, "I would hate it even more to let all this magic go to waste and to leave all of my potential untapped, just because I don''t like how I have to acquire some of it."'
				'"You plan on reading all of it?"'
				'Tatiana shakes her head vehemently. "Fuck no, not if I can help it." After her exclamation, she carefully looks around, like she fears retribution for cursing, but then she continues, softer: "All the knowledge here comes from out there somewhere, and that''s where I wanna find it. But if I have to choose between spending a decade trying to figure something out on my own, and reading a book on it, I''m not gonna waste my time. Would you?"'

					'"Noticed that, didn''t you? Yeah, I guess when I explained to you that magic is in all living things, maybe a better way to put it would have been: ''Magic IS a living thing.'' I don''t know what it is, whether your mind has to be prepared for it, or your magical power has to grow to the point where you can sync it with that in the books, or something else entirely. All I know is that you can''t just grab any book and go nuts - you have to start with the basics and stick to them until you fully comprehend them; then, when you are ready, you''ll be able to move to the next step." She sighs. "Learning takes time, <<$pcs_firstname>>. If I could, I''d be all over books on how to shift the shapes of bodies on a whim, or create life from nothing, but the bottom-line is that you can only skip so many steps."'
					'If what Tatiana said about how normal people perceive magic is true for these books too, then non-magical people would look at them and probably see books they weren''t interested in, you conclude. "So, my only mission here is...?"'

I''ll hold your hand and show you around a little bit, and once you''ve gotten used to the drill and learned a little bit, you can help me out with my investigations, because, frankly," she sighs once more, "I don''t have the time to look into everything myself."'

All I can do in that area is try to show you some things that might make you feel just humbled by time and magic enough to be patient when you have to be - but not so much that you won''t go out and try to experience things for yourself. And encounters with fairies usually go much better than ones with dragons." She chuckles.'

!!! PM from Kevin with notes on missions:
!At the moment we have the story setup the possibility of running some missions for Tatiana but we have no missions. If you want to make a simple action where you ask her if she has a mission and tells you if she does or not and want to make a couple of said missions to fit. That would be very helpful.
!They are magical investigations but the causes doesn''t need to be magical, onlyfor it to appear like it might be. Maybe its some strange lights on the highway at night, but turns out to be a dogging site. The events would have a lot of freedom in length of investigation and whether or not they lead to sex options. So you might have to go somewhere a few times to find something or it might need several visits to sort out the problem.
!Tatiana is a PI and magical investigator so its her way of helping Sveta learn about magic and grow her skills, there will be bigger missions that are handled by Reinhold and it''ll probably require doing x Tatiana missions to unlock the next Rienhold mission type of deal. The rewards while not guaranteed will include new spells and unlocking the hidden magic boutique.
!Oh, I forgot to mention, Gustav can be used for some of the missions with him going along for protection or to help find someone (he has mad tracker skillz). There will be stories linked to some of the chars you meet including a couple of succubae and nymphs, fairies, etc. but also magic artifacts, magical people and people like Gustav who have been mutated by magic (the sharkguy at the pool might be rewritten to fit this last catergory).

!!! IDEAS FOR MISSIONS
! - Tatiana takes Sveta to some place in the city to look into a thimblerigger - It is up to Sveta''s perception and magic skill to determine whether she can make out how he is rigging the game or else sense magic in his actions.
! - Strange lights on the highway - dogging site?
! - If Sveta is a succubus, Tatiana will ask her to look into some sex-related amnesia and exhaustion in Pavlovsk, which Sveta can explain right away
! - Visiting a place where magic got out of hand and is now a barren waste-land (maybe the land was somehow cursed and the authorities made to believe it was a chemical leak?);
! - A trip to the beach where you met a friendly mermaid;

! - A changeling on the loose - a magical creature that can change its appearance at will - dangerous? Maybe a major mission, for/with Reinhold?
