			'Father Kirill leads you to the far side of the cellar and opens another door. In the next room, you see old furniture covered in sheets. A large object hides in the back of the room, perhaps a large wardrobe or some other kind of cabinet. It is partially shouded in sheets, but you can see that the middle section is taller and has a strange looking crucifix topping it. Unlike a proper cross, this on only has a single bar and lacks the slanted bar at the bottom.'
			'As Father Kirill pulls the sheets of it, you can see that there are three sections, each having a curtain covering the entrance. The middle secion is taller and larger than the ones on either end. Even your youthful eye can tell that it is well made and the wood hand carved and fitted by a mastercraftsman. You have no idea what it could be.'
			'"What is it, father?" you ask, admiring the rich polished wood, "Is it a wardrobe?"'
			'"No, <<$pcs_nickname>>." he replies as he folds the sheets, "It is a confessional. An old friend of mine at Saint Nonna''s Cathedral gave it to me. He is a Catholic priest."'
			'"How does it work?" you ask as you peer into the various compartments, "There are no icons and no blessing cross."'
			'"The catholics don''t use those." he chuckled, "Instead, the priest sits in the middle compartment and the penitents sit in the smaller ones. The priest listens to each in turn then assigns them a penance, usually a certain number of prayers or psalms to recite. As each penitent leaves, another enters and the priest just opens and closes the panels inside his section listening to then one after another."'
			'"That''s a dumb way to do it." you reply, examining the panels and screens, "It''s like they turned it into an assembly line. The priest can''t even see who he is talking to."'
			'"It is different, this is true, but different doesn''t mean it is dumb." Father Kirill chastises you, "We are all God''s children and we must be open to new ways and new thoughts for a closed mind cannot hear His voice."'
			'"I''m sorry, father. You''re right, I shouldn''t reject something just because it isn''t what I am used to." you reply, thinking of some of your recent new experiences, "Maybe we should try it out, see what it is like."'
			'"That is exactly what I had in mind." he says smiling at you, "You go in that section, and I''ll go in the middle section."'
			'You sit down in the indicated section and wait as Father Kirill gets into his section. With the heavy curtain closed, it would be fairly dim inside, with the dim lighting in the cellar, it is almost completely dark. You are startled by the sudden sound of the wodden panel next to your head sliding open. You try to look through the carved wooden screen, but you can only make out the vague outline of Father Kirill''s head in the darkness.'
			'"Shall we begin, <<$pcs_nickname>>?" Father Kirill asks you, "You are supposed to say ''Forgive me, father, for I have sinned.'' when you hear the panel open."'
			'"Oh, I''m sorry." you reply feeling your cheeks blush, suddenly glad it is too dark for him to see, "Did you want to start over?"'
			'"I am teasing you, child," the priest says warmly, "We can just carry on, if you like."'
			'You smile in the darkness and tell Father Kirill about some of the things you''ve done and feelings you''ve had, but the novelty of using the confessional keeps you from going into ant real details. Father Kirill seems to feel the same as he doesn''t ask you as many questions as usual. When you are done, you step outside the confessional and you kneel together as you recite the prayer of absolution.'
			'"That was fun." you say after as you leave the cellar, "But it didn''t feel, I don''t know, natural, I guess."'
			'"That is to be expected, it is a new experience." he replies in agreement, "Why don''t we thry using the confessional for a while, maybe a few month, and see how we like it. Maybe once we are used to it, it will feel more natural."'
			'You agree to use the confessional from now on and say goodbye to the priest.'
