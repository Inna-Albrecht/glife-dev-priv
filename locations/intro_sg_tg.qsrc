							'"They bred with humans, and with that human magicians were born. The Sidhe, the most powerful of the fae, feared the increasing number of human magicians and cast a very powerful spell to bind the succubus to them, preventing either from being able to reproduce without the other."'
							'"All magicians have some of that original fae blood in their bodies. It is through that that they are able to connect with the world of magic."'

That source of power is desired by many, but it is extremely dangerous and in the wrong hands could cause untold horrors."'
								'She stops for a few seconds for you to process that information. It seems really far fetched.'
								'"A man named Reinhold wanted to prevent the amulet being misused, so he went out to find it. Of course, the moment you saw him, you dropped the amulet and bolted into the woods. He picked it up but didn''t bother to check you over. Unfortunately, he''s probably realized by now that the amulet no longer has the power and now he''ll be out to hunt you down."'

But if I say, hurl a fireball, then people might see that I threw a grenade or shot a flamethrower. The average human mind can''t process magic, so it blocks it out as a way to protect the person from going crazy."'
									'"Hence such things as little green men, UFOs, poltergeists and spontaneous combustion are from when people encounter a difficult-to-hide phenomenon and their minds come to a flawed conclusion.

											'"I''m not a mage though. How could the power be transferred to me? And what does that have to do with turning me into a girl?"'
											'"Well as for how the power was transferred, it seems that its long time underground caused it to malfunction and its power to enter your body.

Sure, maybe with more time doing research I could have worked out another solution, but I didn''t have a lot of time."'
