# hookahlounge
!!background should be kind of dark, maybe #664d4d
!!time should also pass on entering and leaving, maybe 1 or 2 minutes
!!I intend on adding 2 NPCs, a Muslim woman and a man of undecided origin. Unclear at the moment on what their connection is.
!!Possibility to unlock more drugs to take using the hookah as relationship with Muslim woman progresses.
!!I have an idea to possibly enable Sveta to work at the Hookah Lounge in the future
!!I want something where on repeat visits, Aliyyah (the woman at the counter) greets Sveta by name instead of by "ma'am"
