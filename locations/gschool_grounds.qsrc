She continues by saying that she wants you to go to university so that you can make a better life for yourself.'

They would laugh at me having to be home early for bedtime!"'

Maybe I''ve been a bit harsh in my approach out of habit with Anya but, like I said, I only want the best for you. Can you at least try to meet me half way on this and do your best in school too?"'
							'Unsure how to respond, you sigh. "Okay <<$npc_nickname[''A29'']>>, I''ll try. It''s just that it can get a bit overbearing."'
							'Your mother continues. "Okay, let''s just try to get our relationship back to a good place. Please promise me that you''ll do your best in school too. Also, no matter what please know that you can always talk to me if something is worrying you. Please know that I do love you and want the best for you."'

I love you too and it''ll be good to have my <<$npc_nickname[''A29'']>> back." She hugs you back and you both finish your meals with some more relaxed conversation.'
