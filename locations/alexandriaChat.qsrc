Around 1350, The Veil was fully functional, and we began to see the unwanted side-effects."'

			'"And to end, the answer to the questions all youngsters ask; Yes, we can take down The Veil, but it would require a significant effort similar to its creation as a rushed job would have apocalyptic consequences and there isn''t political support in The Council for this idea. The reason for this is that most of us see The Veil as actually being a good thing. We, the wizards, can continue our quest for knowledge without the pestering masses interfering. As for them, look at what humanity has achieved after the European Renaissance. What new peaks will they reach now that we have distracted them with quantum theory?"'

Like all governments, The Council is a cesspool of drama and backroom deals, a place for the undistinguished penpushers of our society to feel important. My job was going from crisis to crisis without help or acknowledgement, siphoning away my resources and time from more worthy undertakings. In the end, I quit without remorse."'

It''s primary power, is that in exchange for some mana, it will train your unarmed combat skills without the need to do the physical part, letting you grow - let''s hope - in the security of your home... additionally, you don''t need to know Latin to understand it.
