!!make computers_101 a Monday class and art_101 a Tuesday class. I will try and do a 3rd elective next update to finish out enough electives for the first year so the player can have a full schedule, then I will work on adding more later. Goal is to have 12 elective classes, 3 for each year and the player can choose which classes in which year.
