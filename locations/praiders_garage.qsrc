I finally told him she would get tired of it and if they broke up it could ruin the band, he said she would never dump him, yet the next day he broke up with her dumping her.

Then one night after practice, Rad left with some hottie and Nush came onto to me and we had sex all night. We fucked like crazy, afterwards she made it clear she was just looking for a good time and we was just friends still. After that Nush became well Nush, a slutty party girl that likes to get drunk, high, have fun and fuck. Don''t get me wrong, Nush was always a wild girl, but she became, lets call it sexually liberated to go along with her other wild ways.
