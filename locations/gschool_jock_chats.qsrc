			'"You know, I don''t really have time for anything other than training and doing some important things at home." he says, then complains about how although he''d like to be a bit more social, he can''t afford to be distracted by anything.'
			'"I was hoping you''d tell me something more interesting, though. I''m probably more bored now than I was before!" you say jokingly before standing up, dusting yourself off and walking away while waving at him.'
