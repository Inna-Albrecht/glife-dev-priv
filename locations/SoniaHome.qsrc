# SoniaHome
!! This house was created for the Niko Volkov romance, but I made sure to make it compatible for, use on its own, but it is VERY IMPORTANT that all new acts, or code added to this location has a "if NikoAftermath = 0" requirement added to them, or else it will break my quest. Please don''t break my quest. Please.  :(	<3 Violet Kitten   Feel free to PM me, if you have any further questions. ^_^
