	msg 'The rules are very simple.
	First you choose how much you want to wager.
	But note that in our casino maximum rate is 1000 <b>â‚½</b>.
	After that, you can either continue with your bet, or bet on a draw (which costs your bet a second time), for a larger payout.

	Regular:
		Everyone is dealt a card. Face cards have different values.
		Highest card wins. Payout is 1 to 1.
		If both have the same card, choose between continuing (doubles bet), or end the round and return your bet.
		If you win the second round you get a payout of 2 to 1. If it is another draw you get a payout of 1.5 to 1.

	Bet on draw:
		When betting on a draw and winning, you get your bet back.
		However, if it is a draw, the payout will be 10 to 1.

	That''s it. Enjoy the game.'
