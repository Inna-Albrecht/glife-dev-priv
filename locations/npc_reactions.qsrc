# npc_reactions

!! 2022/30/09
!!This file is for npc''s reaction to different aspect of the player character. 
!! It has functions that can be called from an interaction with an npc to add a line of text that reacts to some aspect of the player character.

}

if $ARGS[1] = 'cikl':
	if week = 1:
		killvar 'npc_reaction_weekly'
	end
end

!! This is the code for choosing the aspect of the player character. This is called from a file by func('npc_reactions', 'general', npc_identifier/opinion) and returns a string of text that can be added to the to screen as its own line or to an other string by +
!! $ARGS[1] is either the npc_identifirer for a npc with entry in npc_startic or the name of the npc.
!! $ARGS[2] is npc''s opinion of the player character and is only used for npc's that don't have an identifier. It set to either 'love', 'like', 'indifferent' or 'dislike', if it is not set it will default to the opinion of hate. So remember to set it unless the npc hate the player character.
if $ARGS[0] = 'general':
	if bimbo_flag = 1 and dyneval( 'RESULT = npc_reaction_weekly[''<<$ARGS>>_bimbo'']') = 0:
		dynamic 'npc_reaction_weekly[''<<$ARGS>>_bimbo''] = 1'
		$result = func('npc_reactions', 'bimbo_look', $ARGS[1], $ARGS[2])
	end
	
	killvar 'npc_reactions_temp_preferences'
end

!! This is an example for how the reaction should be done. Feel free to improve the text if you have a better version.
!! Notice how the reactions both depend on the npc''s relationship with the player character and if the like the particular aspect.
!! The preference for an npc with entries in npcstatic is set there. If you want to set the preference for an npc that in not in npcstatic then you have to set npc_reactions_temp_preferences['bimbo'] equal to 1 for like and -1 for dislike before you call the function that gives the reaction.
!! This also means the for some combination of these there might  be an reaction, which is done by having $result = ''
