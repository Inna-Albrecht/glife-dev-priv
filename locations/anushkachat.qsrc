			'You just nod as you listen as she continues. "Anyways they was kinda crap honestly back then, could barely play and the lyrics where awful, they mostly just did covers to practice back then." She pauses a moment as if remembering what it was like. "Even back then Rad was a decent singer a bit raw but you could hear the natural talent. He use to look at me, with that look. The ones boys give you when they really want you, back then it felt amazing to be looked at that way, now I know what that look really means." She finishes with a frown.'
			'You prod her a little. "Then what?"'
			'"Well he was already a bit of a bad boy even then, plus he was the lead singer of a band which was hot, and he payed attention to me the way young girls want guys to pay attention to them."

"At first everything was great, I already knew how to play guitar myself and we talked about that and I helped teaching him what I knew from my dad and he taught me what he knew and we both got better. I also helped him write original songs for the band. In time I asked him if I could join and he let me try out. Rad and Val agreed, shit head didn''t."

				'"So then what happened?" You press her a bit more.'
				'She gives a loud sigh and you can tell she is starting to get annoyed talking about it. "Then we actual started to make a name for ourselves and I don''t just mean with the local kids, but we started to playing at some parties, at the time we just got free booze, drugs and got to hang out with older kids, even played at some of the underground parties as a opening act."'

"That''s when it started, suddenly I had guys hitting on me all the time even guys several years older who before never payed me any attention before. The girls was doing the same with the boys, but I didn''t care, Rad and I was together."'
					'You can tell she is starting to get visible upset and not angry, but like maybe she actually might be on the verge of crying. Then she takes a deep breath calming breath and gets herself back under control and her vulnerable moment passes. "It was after one of the underground parties we played at. After we was done, we joined in with the dancing and partying, then I noticed Rad wasn''t anywhere to be seen. So I went to look for him... Yeah I found him fucking some other chick." Now she seems to be more angry again with saying that. "We fought, he said he was sorry and wouldn''t do it anymore and I forgave him. God I was so fucking stupid." She says harshly.'
					'"But he didn''t stop I caught him several more times with different sluts always. I kept taking him back and forgiving him, then... then he has the nerve to fucking dump me, fucking asshole. Says it is what is best for the band." Then she goes quiet for a moment and looks kinda sad.'
					'"In the end he was right, we should have never dated and should have broke up sooner. It was a good PR move for the band if we both are single to create the fantasy that our fans have a chance with us. It took me awhile to come to that realization." She says shaking her head.'
